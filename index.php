			<p>Karissa is a recent transplant to Albuquerque from ..., and is looking to meet new people and find fun things to do locally.
				She is currently working as a barista at a local coffee shop, but is looking for employment in her field. She moved to Albuquerque
				after college mainly to get a "new perspective" and because she "needed a change of scenery." She is always tweeting quippy observations
				on her phone, noting the idiosyncracies of Albuquerque compared with the midwest where she hails from.</p>
			<p>Karissa likes the people that she works with, but wants to branch out and meet new friends to be able to go see a concert with,
				have a beer, or find new fun local things to do. She is a registered user of Reddit, but mainly uses Reddit for entertainment,
				viewing funny posts and memes, or finding local events and happenings. She is mainly a passive user of Reddit, rarely posting herself, 				instead preferring to use her Twitter account for her personal musings </p>
